# 🚀 SignCraft: Learn Sign Language App 🤟

## Project Overview

**SignCraft** is an ambitious project that aimed to provide a platform for learning sign language using cutting-edge technology. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen time constraints, the project had to be put on hold, and we were unable to complete it as originally envisioned. However, we'd like to share the progress we made and our intentions for the project.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of the **SignCraft** project were as follows:

1. 🤓 **Sign Language Learning**: To create an app that facilitates the learning of sign language, making it accessible to a wide audience, regardless of prior knowledge.

2. 🤖 **Custom Machine Learning Model**: Develop a custom machine learning model utilizing the MediaPipe framework to recognize and interpret sign language gestures accurately.

3. 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that encourages engagement and supports interactive learning.

## Current State

At the time of the project's suspension, we had made significant progress:

- 🧠 **Custom ML Model**: We had successfully implemented a custom machine learning model using MediaPipe for sign language recognition. This model was capable of interpreting hand gestures and mapping them to corresponding sign language words or phrases.

- 🖥️ **User Interface**: The app had a functional and visually appealing user interface, allowing users to practice sign language gestures and receive feedback on their performance.

- 📚 **Educational Content**: We were in the process of curating educational content and resources to provide a comprehensive learning experience for our users.

## Future Plans

While the project is currently on hold, we are committed to revisiting it when circumstances permit. Our future plans include:

- 🏁 **Completion**: Finishing the app's development to create a fully functional, interactive platform for learning sign language.

- 📈 **Expanding Content**: Expanding our library of sign language content, including more languages and dialects.

- 🤝 **Community Engagement**: Incorporating features that allow users to connect, practice together, and share their sign language learning journey.

- ♿ **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the app is accessible and useful for a wide range of users, including individuals with hearing disabilities.

## Contributing

We are open to collaboration and contributions from the community. If you share our vision and want to contribute to the **SignCraft** project, please feel free to reach out to us.
